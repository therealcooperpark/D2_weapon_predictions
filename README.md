  # D2 Weapon Predictions
  
  This is my attempt at building a Machine Learning model to accurately predict the archetype of a weapon from Destiny 2 given its characteristics. Right now, this model will include:
  
  - Stats (e.g., handling, range, magazine size)
  - Perk availability (e.g., Quickdraw, Rampage)
  
  All data is pulled from Destiny's API via the great work by [altbdoor](https://altbdoor.github.io/d2-api-human/)!
  
  This README will be updated as new features become available! Stay tuned!
