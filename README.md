  # D2 Weapon Predictions
  
  This is my attempt at building a Machine Learning model to accurately predict the archetype of a weapon from Destiny 2 given its characteristics. Right now, this model will include:
  
  - Stats (e.g., handling, range, magazine size)
  - Perk availability (e.g., Quickdraw, Rampage)
  
  All data is pulled from Destiny's API - thanks Bungie!
  
  This README will be updated as new features become available! Stay tuned!
