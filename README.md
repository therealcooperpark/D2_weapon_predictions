  # D2 Weapon Predictions
  
  This is my attempt at building a Machine Learning model to accurately predict the archetype of a weapon from Destiny 2 given its characteristics. Right now, this model will include:
  
  - Stats (e.g., handling, range, magazine size)
  - Element Type (e.g., Arc, Solar, Void, Stasis)
  - Ammo type (e.g., Primary, Special, Heavy)

  All data is pulled from Destiny's API via the great work by [altbdoor](https://altbdoor.github.io/d2-api-human/)!
  
  This README will be updated as new features become available! Stay tuned!

  ## Future goals

  - Increase difficulty of algorithm predictions by removing Ammo type consideration
  - Add perk pools to predictions to see if that alters prediction reliability
  - Try to predict weapon frame, along with weapon type (or frame within a type)
    - Can combine any of the other future goals with this one too
  - Try to predict weapon rarity given stats (or anything else)
    - Can combine any of the other future goals with this one too
